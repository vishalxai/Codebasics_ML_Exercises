# Multiclass Logistic Regression (Iris Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification** using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
We predict the species of a flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

## 📂 Contents
- Data Exploration and Visualization (sepal vs petal features)
- Train-Test Split
- Logistic Regression (Multinomial with Softmax)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Accuracy Reporting

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🎯 Results
- Logistic Regression achieved **high accuracy** on the Iris dataset.
- Supports **multiclass classification** with softmax decision boundaries.

Climate Stability Analysis ðŸŒ¾

Problem

Compare temperature variability between City A and City B to recommend the best location for agricultural investment.
Key factor: lower variability (standard deviation) = more stable climate.

Data

File: climate_stability_comparison.xlsx
	â€¢	month
	â€¢	Avg Temp City A (Â°C)
	â€¢	Avg Temp City B (Â°C)

Approach
	â€¢	Calculated standard deviation of temperatures for both cities.
	â€¢	Visualized trends using line plot and boxplot.

Result
	â€¢	City A â†’ Lower std dev â†’ More stable climate.
	â€¢	âœ… Recommended for agricultural investment.

# Exercise 1 – Telco Churn Analysis

## Objective
Analyze customer churn patterns using the Telco dataset, focusing on contract type, churn status, charges, and tenure.

## Key Analysis
- Month-to-month churned customers generate significantly less lifetime revenue.  
- Non-churned two-year contract customers have a **median tenure of 64 months**.  
- Revenue gap: churned (~₹1164) vs non-churned (~₹1522).

## Business Recommendations
- Incentivize short-term customers to switch to longer-term contracts.  
- Use loyalty perks, bundles, or discounts to reduce churn.  
- Focus retention strategy on month-to-month customers (high risk, low value).
